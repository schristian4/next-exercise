## Question 7

How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?

## Answer

After thoroughly reviewing and answering the questions, I've identified a few areas that could benefit from improvement. It should be clear to candidates whether their answers will be evaluated based on technical accuracy, innovative problem-solving, or the effectiveness of their communication. Clarifying the assessment criteria not only helps candidates to focus their efforts more effectively but also ensures that their responses meet the expectations of the exercise.

For instance, the current responses do not specify what forms of assistance can be provided to the customer. They also lack detail on which approaches are permissible or may be requested to the customer.
