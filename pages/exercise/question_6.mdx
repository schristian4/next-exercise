## Question 6

A customer is creating a site and would like their project not to be indexed by search engines. Please write a reply to the customer.

## Answer

Hi Customer Name,

Thank you for reaching out with your request. I understand you would like to keep your site private and not indexed by search engines. We can certainly help with that.

Vercel Preview Deployments are not indexed by search engines by default because the X-Robots-Tag HTTP header is set to noindex. If you are using a Custom Domain that is assigned to a non-Production Branch, however, the header X-Robots-Tag: noindex will not be set.

To confirm the value of the X-Robots-Tag header, you can use the following curl (already available on most desktop devices) command in your terminal to check your Preview Deployment's headers:

```curl {3} copy
curl -I <preview-deployment-url>
```

Amongst the output, you will find an X-Robots-Tag header after executing the curl command.

```
x-robots-tag: noindex
```

For more details on how Vercel handles search engine indexing for preview deployments, please refer to our guide: [Preview deployment - Index search engines](https://vercel.com/guides/are-vercel-preview-deployment-indexed-by-search-engines)

Additionally, to prevent search engines from indexing your site, you can use a robots.txt file or add meta tags to your web pages. The Next.js documentation provides a guide on how to add a robots.txt file to your root directory of your Next App to prevent search engines from indexing your site:

If you need any help implementing these changes or have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks again.
